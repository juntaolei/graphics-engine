# Computer Graphics Final Project

Jun Tao Lei, Period 10

## List of Features to be Implemented

### Existing MDL Commands

* Light
* Mesh

### Modifying Existing MDL Commands

* Modify the current line algorithm to support antialiasing (possibly Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm). There should not be any change to how the function is called. 

### Nice to Have Commands

* Shading
* Add global illumination with path tracing or some other method. However, this is only a secondary focus if I have time left to attempt it.
